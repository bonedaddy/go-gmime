Subject:
HSBC LONDON
From:
"foobar@terra.es"
I am Shamash Din Choudhry,British citizen and Principal assurance manager
for the HSBC in London. A staff of Yokozona consultancy firm got in touch
with me regarding the estate of Simeon Arag. And an investment placed under
our banks management 3 years ago. I would respectfully request that you
keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of
the information you come by as a result of this mail. I contact you
independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this
communication. I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I
believe would be of interest to you.

In 1997, the subject matter;Simeon Arag came to our bank to engage in
business discussions with our private banking division. He informed us that
he had a financial portfolio of 8.35 million United States dollars, which
he wished to have us turn over (invest) on his behalf. I was the officer
assigned to his case, I made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as
the de-facto chief operations officer, especially given the volume of funds
he wished to put into our bank. We met on numerous occasions prior to any
investments being placed. I encouraged him to consider various growth funds
with prime ratings. The favored route in my advice to customers is to start
by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers and 2000
managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, We spun the money
around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first
months of operation, the accrued profit and interest stood at this point at
over 10 million United States Dollars, this margin was not the full
potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on
investments. In mid 1998, he asked that the money be liquidated because he
needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in United
Kindom. He directed that I liquidate the funds and had it deposited with
United Assets Management Uk (in their Securities Trading Firm).

I informed him that HSBC London would have to make special arrangements to
have this done and in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would
have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and
statutory charges. He complained about the charges but later came around
when I explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us.
Cash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the
incidents of 9/11. I contacted my affiliate in United Kingdom and had the
funds available in United Assets Management.I undertook all the processes
and made sure I followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the
funds deposited at United Assets Management Uk United Kindom. United Assets
Management Uk is a specialist bank that accepts deposits from high net
worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable products
or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. In Line with
instructions, the money was deposited with United Assets Management Uk (in
their Securities Trading Firm). Simeon Arag told me he wanted the money
there as soon as he got into the United Kindom,This was the last
communication we had, this transpired around 25th February 1999.In Sept
last year, we got a call from United Assets Management Uk informing us
about the inactivity of that particular portfolio. This was an astounding
position as far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the
International private banking sector I was the only one who knew about the
deposit at United Assets Management Uk, and I could not understand why
Simeon Arag had not come forward to claim his deposit. I made futile
efforts to locate Simeon Arag. Four days later, information started to
trickle in, apparently Simeon Arag was dead. A person who suited his
description was declared dead of AUTO ACCIDENT TRAUMA in Birmingham
England. We were soon enough able to identify the body and cause of death
was confirmed. The bank immediately launched an investigation into possible
surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward
to claim his estate. In the field of private banking, opening an account
with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held
under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts
anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their
mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no
traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin.
Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually
in most cases leave wills in our care, in this case;Simeon Arag died in
testate.

In line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed
away, we instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who
should have right to claim the estate. This investigation has for the past
months been unfruitful. We have scanned every continent and used our
private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the
problem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with
your details as a possible relative of the deceased. My official capacity
dictates that I am the only party to supervise the investigation and the
only party to receive the results of the investigation. You have
unfortunately declared, and I know that you are in no way affiliated with
this individual. What this means, you being the last batch of names we have
considered is that our dear late fellow died with no known or identifiable
family member. This leaves me as the only person with the full picture of
what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late
beneficiary of the deposit.

According to practice, United Assets Management Uk will by the end of this
quarter broadcast a request for statements of claim to HSBC in London,
failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert the deposit
back to HSBC in London. This will result in the money entering the HSBC in
London accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out
of the private banking division. This will not happen if I have my way.What
I wish to relate to you will smack off unethical practice but I want you to
understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds
the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The world of
private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who
occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have
begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose. There
is US$ 8,370,000.00 deposited in United Assets Management Uk, I alone have
the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I
instruct them to do so. I alone know of the existence of this deposit for
as far as United Assets Management Uk is concerned, the transaction with
Simeon Arag concluded when I sent the funds to United Assets Management Uk,
all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just customer
services and due process. United Assets Management Uk has no single idea of
the history or nature of the deposit. They are simply awaiting instructions
to release the deposit to any party that comes forward. This is the
situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this
man's family; they have investigated for months and have found no family.
The investigation has come to an end.

My proposal, I am prepared to place you as the next of kin in a position to
instruct United Assets Management Uk to release the deposit to you as the
closest surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to
share the money with you in half. That is: I will simply nominate you as
the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you. We share the
proceeds 50/50.I would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me,
but that would have drawn a straight line in my involvement in claiming the
deposit. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you within
a few days. I will simply inform the bank of the final closing of the file
relating to Simeon Arag I will then officially communicate with United
Assets Management Uk and instruct them to release the deposit to you. With
these: all is done. I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask
that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this
mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive. If my offer is
of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you.
Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal. You may
not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of
comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I am not a
criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be
hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I
make this move. Such opportunities only come ones way once in a lifetime. I
cannot let this chance pass me by, for once I find myself in total control
of my destiny. These chances wont pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy
my chance, if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with
my life but do not destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity
to provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project
and it is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the
only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my
bank. I am the only one who knows of this situation, good fortune has
blessed you with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance
in my life. Lets share the blessing.

If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a
conclusion. I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official
channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do
not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want
you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only
through the numbers I will provide for you and also through this email
address. I do not want any direct link between you and me. My official
lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our
level of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management
Policy.Please observe this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I
am a family man, I have wife and children. I send you this mail not without
a measure of fear as to what the consequences, but I know within me that
nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come
easy or on a platter of gold. This is the one truth I have learned from my
private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence as I would appreciate
that you copy and respond back to me via this given email
contact:foobar@gmail.com, If we can be of one accord, we should plan a
meeting, soon.

I await your response.
Respectfully,
Shamash Din Choudhry.
